# psmultilevel
This is an R package which offers functions to calculate propensity scores weighting estimators and their standard errors for the treatment effect in a clustered data setting. The treatment is assigned at an individual level and not cluster level. 

This package also contains one simulated dataset `simdata` which can be used to demonstrate the package's functions.
